# Stock-Price-Prediction
## AIM
To develop a Recurrent Neural Network model for stock price prediction.

## Problem Statement and Dataset
Given dataset of stock prices with relevant features. Extract one column and perform prediction for the next data in the series using Recurrent Neural Network. 

## Design Steps
### Step 1:
Import required libraries and load the dataset separately for training and testing.
### Step 2:
Preprocess the data using MinMaxScaler. Create sequences and split into x train, y train and x test, y test. Convert to tensors and create dataloader for batchwise training.
### Step 3:
Define the recurrent model 


## Program
